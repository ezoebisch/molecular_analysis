code to analyze molecules &amp; nano_molecules

Hi githubbers, EV G here.  

I'm analyzing molecular data from databases and modeling output. Particular interests are in solvation and non-bonded interactions.  

Also, I teach math and chemistry to high school and middle school students. As I watch students struggle I think, 'This is a waste'. Why not find a way to teach that is soooo compeling the students think it easy to solve problems? OK, I admit it's a bit unrealistic. I've had some successes and the students tell me it's working. I'm not convinced. Still, I think we can do better.
