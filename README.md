Hi githubbers, Evie G here.  

I teach math and chemistry to middle school students (I like a challenge).  As I watch students struggle to learn I think, 'This is a waste'.  Why not find a way to teach that is soooo compeling the students think it easy to solve problems. OK, I admit it's a bit unrealistic.  I've had some successes and the students tell me it's working, I'm not convinced. I still think we can do better. Better learning through software.  

I also work on approximations for electrostatic equations used in protein molecular modeling.
